My name is Andrey Smirnov. I work for [Virtustream](http://virtustream.com/). I'm a big fan of
Go, Python, DevOps and high-load projects.

Previously, I was team development lead at Skype Qik (Microsoft).  There my
team was in charge of the asynchronous communication backend.

Prior to that I was leading development of smotri.com, a Russian clone
of YouTube. You can see my [resume here](http://smira.ru/cv-eng.pdf) to get
more details.

Some of my open-source projects are: [Redis Resharding Proxy](https://github.com/smira/redis-resharding-proxy)
and [txZMQ](https://github.com/smira/txZMQ). I've developed Flash broadcasting backend (smotri.com), call signalling and notification (Qik), and many other products.

I frequently give talks at conferences.  A long time ago I taught at Moscow State University.
