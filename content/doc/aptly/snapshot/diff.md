aptly snapshot diff
-------------------

Displays difference in packages between two snapshots. Snapshot is a
list of packages, so difference between snapshots is a difference
between package lists. Package could be either completely missing in one
of the snapshots, or package is present in both snapshots with different
versions.

Usage:

    $ aptly snapshot diff <name-a> <name-b>

Params:

-   `name-a` is snapshot name which is "on the left" during comparison
-   `name-b` is snapshot name which is "on the right" during comparison

Flags:

-   `-only-matching`: display diff only for package versions
    (don't display missing packages)

Example:

    $ aptly snapshot diff snap-deb2-main snap-deb-main-w-xorg
      Arch   | Package            | Version in A     | Version in B
